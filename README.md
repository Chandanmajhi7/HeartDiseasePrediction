# Heart Assistant

**Heart Assistant** is a Streamlit web application designed for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on user inputs. The application leverages a machine learning model to analyze various health metrics and provide a prediction on whether an individual might be suffering from heart disease.

## Features

- **User Input Fields**: Enter various health parameters such as age, sex, chest pain types, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.
- **Prediction Model**: Uses a pre-trained heart disease prediction model to analyze the inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a clean and interactive interface with custom styling for an enhanced user experience.

## Project Description

The Heart Assistant project is built using Python and Streamlit, with the main functionality being driven by a machine learning model. The application allows users to input various health metrics and receive a prediction on their heart disease status. The model used for prediction is a serialized object that has been trained on relevant data.

### Installation

To run the Heart Assistant web application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
